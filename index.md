Hey there, I'm **Shatabarto Bhattacharya**, but most folks just call me **"Rik"**.

I'm truly passionate about open source collaborations, blockchain technology, deep learning, and the
dynamic landscape of finance, with a special fascination for decentralized derivative markets. I have a
keen interest in anything that incorporates elements of mathematics or physics into the equation.

Additionally, I take pleasure in immersing myself in a wide range of music genres, from
the soothing rhythms of Bossa Nova to the unique melodies of Tuvan throat singing.
