## Introduction
Hi, I am Shatabarto Bhattacharya aka "Rik". You already know a bit about me from this website's [homepage](/).
I have been working on this website and I decided to make it on top of jekyll and a custom theme based on imageboards that you can always [check out and fork](https://github.com/hrik2001/hrik2001.github.io). The main motivation of having a blog is to write down the things I learn over time to not only showcase myself, but also to get better in writing and being a _wordcel_. I don't know how commited I would be to write blogs here, but I will try my best, as I have plenty of interesting projects that I am/will be working on.
